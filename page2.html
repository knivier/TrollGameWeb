      <h2 style="text-align: center; color: salmon">v4.4 | Adventure Mode</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Hello and welcome to Version 4.4! We've finally included a native changelog inside
        the project now, along with the new adventure mode and many other changes. This is one of the most heavy changes
        we've made to version 4, we hope you enjoy it! <br>A quick TLDR for those that don't want to read the changelog:
        We've finally included an alternate mode incase you just want to play the game without making as much money as
        possible. While money is still one of your objectives in adventure mode, it's not the primary goal. This mode
        will continue to be built on, so content on adventure mode is currently lacking. This won't be for long with
        v4.5!</p>
