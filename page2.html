      <h2 style="text-align: center; color: salmon">v4.5 Peek | Adventurous Pickings</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to v4.5, the overhaul to the adventure mode that was created in v4.4! I'm
        currently working on this update, but it is in the works and will be out relatively soon. Things to know: </p>
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <li>Bug fixes will drastically improve experience</li>
        <li>Mass content overflow for Adventure mode</li>
        <li>Modability and code readability (ex method comments) improved</li>
        <li>Continuation of LTS for the v4 lineup, including better backward compatibility runthroughs</li>
      </ul>
<p>That's right, the v4 lineup will continue to be updated from time to time. We don't plan on releasing v5 anytime soon, nor any major feature drops. This is due to time constraints, and the fact that I currently don't have a roadmap of what our game is going through. I'll be making a visual roadmap later on that I can post to this feed, but for now v4 will be continued onwards. <br> The expected EOL date for the v4 lineup will be December 19th, 2024 right now. We will release v5 after the EOL passes. <br> Notice: The content being added to updates is continuing to build up. You may encounter more temporary issues later on, but they will immediately stabilize.  </p>

      <h2 style="text-align: center; color: salmon">v4.4 | Adventure Mode</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 10px;">Hello and welcome to Version 4.4! We've finally included a
        native changelog inside
        the project now, along with the new adventure mode and many other changes. This is one of the most heavy changes
        we've made to version 4, we hope you enjoy it! <br>A quick TLDR for those that don't want to read the changelog:
        We've finally included an alternate mode incase you just want to play the game without making as much money as
        possible. While money is still one of your objectives in adventure mode, it's not the primary goal. This mode
        will continue to be built on, so content on adventure mode is currently lacking. This won't be for long with
        v4.5!</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center; color: salmon">Changelog for v4.4:</h3>
