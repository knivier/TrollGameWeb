          From the Creator </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Hi, I'm Knivier! I'm the solo for Troll Game that created this game in January of
          2024. Since then, I've continued to update this simple text-based game into something far more complex, but
          with an extremely low learning curve. This website will serve as a guide for new players, and also as an update section. </p>

        Game Information

      <h3 style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: center;">The Game</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: center; padding: 0 10px;">Troll Game is a simple game where you're the leader of the trolls. You once helped
        the Troll community during a hellhound raid, and they owe you. The Trolls are locked into an eternal battle
        against Archie the Dragon. Your goal depends on what mode you play in. Ranked mode allows you to go through
        gameplay quicker and it's goal is to make as much money as possible. Adventure mode (in progress) allows you to
        fully appreciate the games mechanics with better simulations and slowed mechanics.</p>
      <h3 style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: center;">How do I get playing?</h3>
      <p style="text-align: center; padding: 0 10px;"> To get started with the game, all you need to do is download the game JAR file. Make sure your Java version
        (&JDK) is at least 17 (reccomended: 22). You can also download the run.bat file with the Java file which, when
        executed, will automatically execute the Java file without needing a terminal. Go to my Github page at <a
          href="https://github.com/knivier/trollgame">https://github.com/knivier/trollgame/releases/tag/v4.4</a> and
        download the latest version in the binaries. Always make sure to have the latest version of Java installed, and
        the latest version of the game installed aswell. If something isn't working right, it's most likely due to
        version control issues. If this doesn't make sense to you, <a href="https://github.com/knivier/trollgame/releases/tag/v4.2">check out v4.2</a> instructions for running the Jar file without downloading the run.bat file. Do NOT run v4.2, just take the instruction set from it. 
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: center;">Can I contribute?</h3>
      <p style="text-align: center; padding: 0 10px;">While I'm not looking for anyone to work with for this game, you can certainly download the game base files and
        start modding the game! Just head to the GitHub project page and go to the latest version and download all the
        files. If you want to share your mods for the game, feel free to do so! I use (and personally reccomend) IntelliJ IDEA for this game. You can download it at <a
          href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/</a>. However if you are a beginner, you
        can also mod the game using BlueJ! As of v4.4, BlueJ package files will no longer be included because I no
        longer have any need to continue building the project inside BlueJ. The last BlueJ project file continuation is
        v4.3 which you can see <a href="https://github.com/knivier/trollgame/releases/tag/v4.3">here</a>. However, if you see a bug, please open up an issue and feel free to resolve it! If you have any additional comments or ideas for the game, contact me via Discord "knivier".</p>
